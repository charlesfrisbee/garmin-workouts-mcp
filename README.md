# Garmin Workouts MCP

Create Garmin Connect workouts using natural language descriptions. Built as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

## Installation

### Claude Code (Recommended)

```bash
claude mcp add garmin-workouts-mcp npx garmin-workouts-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your configuration file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-workouts-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "garmin-workouts-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Desktop.

## Usage

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Auth tokens expire after ~5 minutes. Plan multiple workouts and create them all in one session.

### Quick Start
Just start creating workouts! The server will prompt for authentication if needed.

**Create a single workout:**
"Create a 10 min warmup, 5x1km threshold intervals with 2 min rest, then 10 min cooldown"

**Create multiple workouts in one session:**
```
"Create these 3 workouts:
1. Easy 30 min run in zone 2  
2. 5x1km threshold intervals with 2 min rest
3. 10x30 second sprints with 90 second recovery"
```

### How It Works
1. **Request workouts** - Describe what you want to create
2. **Auto-authentication** - Browser opens for login when tokens expire
3. **Batch creation** - Create multiple workouts in the same session

## Example Workouts

- **Easy run**: "30 minute easy run in zone 2"
- **Intervals**: "5x400m at 5k pace with 60 second rest"
- **Threshold**: "10 min warmup, 20 min tempo in zone 4, 10 min cooldown"
- **Sprints**: "Warmup 10 min, then 8x15 second sprints with 3 min recovery"
- **Complex**: "Pyramid workout: 1-2-3-4-3-2-1 minutes hard with equal recovery"

## Features

- üèÉ **Multi-sport support** - Running, cycling, and swimming workouts

3. Creates the workout directly in your Garmin Connect account
4. Syncs automatically to your Garmin device
